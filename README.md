# PCSweb
 PCSwebsite
This is the website repository for thePCS. It's open to anyone who wants to make their own commits.
Hopefully you can see everything thats in the repository, I'm new to most of this, so you'll have to bear with me.


/* This is all just a template, we can totaly use WP for the whole site, this is a start. If possible,
lets just put the side bar items in the nav bar, AND make it an infinty page, just to simply everything.
If isra can do up some images, we can pull off some neat stuff in WP to make it LIVE, like motion effects.
